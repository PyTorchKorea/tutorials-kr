        "(prototype) GPU Quantization with TorchAO\n=========================================\n\n**Author**: [HDCharles](https://github.com/HDCharles)\n\nIn this tutorial, we will walk you through the quantization and\noptimization of the popular [segment anything\nmodel](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything). These\nsteps will mimic some of those taken to develop the\n[segment-anything-fast](https://github.com/pytorch-labs/segment-anything-fast/blob/main/segment_anything_fast/modeling/image_encoder.py#L15)\nrepo. This step-by-step guide demonstrates how you can apply these\ntechniques to speed up your own models, especially those that use\ntransformers. To that end, we will focus on widely applicable\ntechniques, such as optimizing performance with `torch.compile` and\nquantization and measure their impact.\n"

        "The first time this is run, you should see a sequence of `AUTOTUNE`\noutputs which occurs when inductor compares the performance between\nvarious kernel parameters for a kernel. This only happens once (unless\nyou delete your cache) so if you run the cell again you should just get\nthe benchmark output.\n\n`torch.compile` yields about another 27% improvement. This brings the\nmodel to a reasonable baseline where we now have to work a bit harder\nfor improvements.\n\nNext, let\\'s apply quantization. Quantization for GPUs comes in three\nmain forms in [torchao](https://github.com/pytorch-labs/ao) which is\njust native pytorch+python code. This includes:\n\n-   int8 dynamic quantization\n-   int8 weight-only quantization\n-   int4 weight-only quantization\n\nDifferent models, or sometimes different layers in a model can require\ndifferent techniques. For models which are heavily compute bound,\ndynamic quantization tends to work the best since it swaps the normal\nexpensive floating point matmul ops with integer versions. Weight-only\nquantization works better in memory bound situations where the benefit\ncomes from loading less weight data, rather than doing less computation.\nThe torchao APIs:\n\n`change_linear_weights_to_int8_dqtensors`,\n`change_linear_weights_to_int8_woqtensors` or\n`change_linear_weights_to_int4_woqtensors`\n\ncan be used to easily apply the desired quantization technique and then\nonce the model is compiled with `torch.compile` with `max-autotune`,\nquantization is complete and we can see our speedup.\n\n```{=html}\n<div style=\"background-color: #54c7ec; color: #fff; font-weight: 700; padding-left: 10px; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px\"><strong>NOTE:</strong></div>\n```\n```{=html}\n<div style=\"background-color: #f3f4f7; padding-left: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-right: 10px\">\n```\n```{=html}\n<p>You might experience issues with these on older versions of PyTorch. If you runinto an issue, you can use <code>apply_dynamic_quant</code> and<code>apply_weight_only_int8_quant</code> instead as drop in replacement for the twoabove (no replacement for int4).The difference between the two APIs is that <code>change_linear_weights</code> API</p>\n```\n```{=html}\n</div>\n```\nalters the weight tensor of the linear module so instead of doing a\nnormal linear, it does a quantized operation. This is helpful when you\nhave non-standard linear ops that do more than one thing. The `apply`\nAPIs directly swap the linear modules for a quantized module which works\non older versions but doesn't work with non-standard linear modules.\n\nIn this case Segment Anything is compute-bound so we'll use dynamic\nquantization:\n"
